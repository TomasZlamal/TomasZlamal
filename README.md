- I’m @TomasZlamal
- I have a computer science education background, so my most proficient programming language is Java (since it was taught there),
though I am currentely planning to learn mainly some back end, a few front end languages and some that don't
fit in either category (R, Python (in context of Data Science)).
- I’m interested in Java projects, web projects and data analysis projects (HTML, CSS, SQL, R
and JS).
- I’m currently learning Java, JS,  R.
- The programming languages I know (from most knowledgeable
to least): Java, JS, CSS, HTML, SQL, R.
- I am currentely learning Data Analytics as I am planning to branch off into
Deep Learning / Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence to create games that combine
those into them.
- You are free to create pull requests if you believe there is an improvement to be made
in one of my projects and I'll gladly review it.
- Contact me if you are interested in collaborating on a project!
